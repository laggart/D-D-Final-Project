# D&D app (ironhack-final)

Final Project IronHack Front-End-Vue Bootcamp D&D Companion

### Lets start ðŸš€

In this project we aim to make a D&D Companion with a character Sheet generator, a plece where you can find all your Character take them everywhere and bring them to life (a little bit ;) ).

In a way all main goal was to get todether a clasic board game with a interactive WebApp companion, so you can have fun with your friends everywhere.

Using an awesome database _"Supabase"_ you can store all characters you create in the App. 
Also if you are not quite happy with the results you can edit them.
And if you get tired of one character angry with, or even if he/she dies (in game only we hope) you can delete it.

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).


### Challenges
the big issue I found doing this project was Supabase, Getting my data fetch and edited seems easy, 
but when you are a Database Noob like me aiming to the right stuff in this App and getting in the DataBase it has been a true puzzle.

I use quasar for the first time and it helps a lot making the main structure, in that way its awesome but his way to store things it's making me crazy trying to fix the img deployment in the deployed app.

I learned a lot using libraries, SCSS SASS.
